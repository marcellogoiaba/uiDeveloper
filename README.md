# Roomex UI Developer Assignment #

### The Roomex UI Developer ###

Roomex are creating a new application and have asked you to help setup the HTML and CSS. 

First clone and run the sample application. 

We have sent you a link to a Zeplin Wireframe, if you did not receive your invitation please contact us immediately. 


The task is to implement the wireframes in HTML and CSS. There are two 'views', for mobile and desktop.

The Mobile view has a hamburger menu with the same menu options as the desktop version. 

The sample image is include in the src/assets/img folder

### What are we looking for? ###

Show us what you can do with CSS and HTML but if you need to use Javascript that's no problem

You are free to use any third-party libraries you see fit but we prefer Bootstrap

Animations, Nested Selectors, Media Queries, Variables and Mixins are great. 

A well organised file structure that can grow with the site is great too.

### How do I get set up? ###

The application is running Angular 7. You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 8.x or 10.x.

* Install or upgrade to the latest version of the Angular CLI

`npm install -g @angular/cli`

* Checkout the latest version of the project from the repository from the command line:

`git clone git@bitbucket.org:rxfrontend/uideveloper.git`

* Change to the repo directory

`cd uideveloper`

* Install and run the project, the app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

`npm install && ng serve`

* You may return the completed work in any way that suits you e.g.
  * a github link 
  * a zip file (please remove the node_modules folder in order to keep the file size down)

*Please do not commit your work back to the origial repository* 

* Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Who do I talk to? ###
